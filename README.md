JustCSS pretend to be the simplest of all CSS frameworks and a project in order to learn more about how CSS works and its capabilities

As I am a student I will update this repository as many time as I can, of course, any help should be appreciated doesn't matter if it is for add a feature or if it is just for comment the code, help will be appreciated.

As I said before this pretend to be the simplest CSS Framework on the internet.

The code isn't documented yet,but I will try to comment all the code when I finish all the exams.

Things that are more-less done:

* Buttons
  * Flat-Buttons
  * Shadowed Buttons
  * Buttons with Icons
  * Simple animation on hover in buttons
* Grid
  * Made a simple grid that does the job but I have to add some more features
  * Added option for tablet, mobile, and desktop
* Forms
  * Custom Input Boxes (I like a lot the style, includes Icons)
  * Custom Radio Buttons (Also cools)
  * Custom Checkboxes (I like too)
* Utilities
  * I added some helper classes like center text or align to the left or right anything
  
Maybe the code isn't the cleanest code you ever saw but I think with time I will fix this bug üòè
